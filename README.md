# NetAutomation
Homework for the IPSpace Network Automation course

A simple lab topology conisisting of:

Two sites:
    Each site has 4 x NX-OSv routers
    A single OSPF area
    Site BPG ASN
    Linux server

The two sites will connect via a pair of IOSv routers acting as a dual core.

The topology also allows me to add ASAv firewalls later.

For simplicity, at times only one site will be powered up.
